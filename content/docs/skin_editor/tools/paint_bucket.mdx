## Description
The **Paint Bucket** is a tool that lets you fill large closed areas with a specific color. It can also replace a specific color with another on the whole canvas if the **Contiguous** toggle is on. Unlike many other skin editors, the bucket tool on needcoolershoes wraps around the edges of skin parts.

## How to use
- **Right Click** on an area the bucket should fill
- **Left Click** on an area the bucket should erase

## Modifiers
- **Contiguous** - Replaces the clicked color on the whole canvas instead of only replacing a closed area
- **Noise** - Applies a noise effect to filled pixels
- **Blend** - Colors of filled pixels are picked randomly from the **Blend Palette**
