## Description
The **Eraser** is a simple tool that lets you **erase parts of the skin using strokes of pixels**, just like the **Brush**. It isn't any different from just **Right Clicking with the Brush** but it was added for accessibility such as Touch Screen Devices or people who are used to using the eraser keybind.

## How to use
- Hold the **Right/Left Mouse Button** to **Erase**

## Modifiers
- **Mirror** - Duplicates the pixel strokes on the opposite side of the skin
