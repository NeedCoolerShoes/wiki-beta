In **January of 2023** the popular skin editing website **"Miners Need Cool Shoes"** under the domain `needcoolshoes.com` went dark. Users of the site would quickly realize that the site didn't really come back up, and it wasn't temporary. 

They published many posts online lamenting about the loss of the editor, which despite not really being updated for a long time, had the best layer support out of all online editors for a long time, so the lament was understandable.

During **April 2023** **Wulfian**, a friend of **Moxvallix** and a prolific user of the Miners Need Cool Shoes editor wished to make a set of skins for a friend group, which he couldn't as the site was down.

After seeing the demand for the editor, **Moxvallix** decided to take the **Wayback Machine** archive of Miners Need Cool Shoes, managed to make the editor (barely) working and put it up at [coolshoes.moxvallix.com](https://coolshoes.moxvallix.com/). 

Users of the old site quickly got quite excited about the website being back up again. Despite the excitement, one vital aspect of the site was still missing, the gallery. The editor **Moxvallix** managed to get working was just a static client-side website.

Within a couple days of [coolshoes.moxvallix.com](https://coolshoes.moxvallix.com/) being up, **Moxvallix** created it's successor: [needcoolershoes.com](https://needcoolershoes.com/). Since source code of the editor wasn't public, it was hard to add any features to the editor, but **Moxvallix** managed to hack an upload form into the editor and the gallery was up and running. 

It didn't take long for the new website to gain traction. Within just 11 days the website hit 100 skins and a month after, 500.

At the **30th of April 2025**, during Need Cooler Shoes' 2nd anniversary the **New Need Cooler Shoes editor** was officially released after more than a year of development. This milestone made **Need Cooler Shoes** finally fully **Open Source**.
